# Tweets-Count


This is a simple app built using JavaScript , HTML and CSS. 

We all have that struggle when we write our tweets we hit alt Enter and end up sending our tweet unvoluntarily. so I built that twitter that help people draft their text, by words and also let yoiu see how your twee will look like. If it is sent.


Up coming features:
